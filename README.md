#chatbot has two text boxes, one for the user to enter their question and one for the chatbot to display its answer

The code creates a simple chatbot using the Tkinter library. The chatbot has two text boxes, one for the user to enter their question and one for the chatbot to display its answer.

The ask list contains the greetings that the chatbot will respond to. The hi list contains the chatbot's possible responses to greetings. The error list contains the chatbot's possible responses to questions that it does not understand.

The main() function is called when the user clicks the "speak" button. This function gets the user's question from the first text box and checks if it is in the ask list. If it is, the function sets the chatbot's answer to a random element from the hi list. Otherwise, the function sets the chatbot's answer to a random element from the error list.

The Button() function creates a button with the text "speak". When the user clicks this button, the main() function is called.

The mainloop() function keeps the chatbot running until the user closes the window.
